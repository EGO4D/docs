# Welcome To Ego4d!

Ego4d is the world's largest egocentric (first person) video ML dataset, with 3,400 hrs of densely narrated video in release 1 (more coming) and a wide range of [annotations](/docs/data/data-overview) across [benchmark tasks](/docs/benchmarks/overview). 

# Start Here

Let's first walk through downloading the core dataset, what options are available and how we suggest you start with the data.  

The rough flow for a typical researcher will be:

1. [Sign the license.](#sign-the-license)  (It's takes 48 to receive credentials.)
1. [Download the CLI.](#Download-The-CLI)

## Sign The License

Obtaining the dataset or any annotations requires you first sign a license.  Go here to sign the license, and you will be emailed a set of AWS credentials when your signature is approved, which will take ~ 48 hrs.  (In the meantime, you can check out sample notebooks here.)

## Download The CLI

Download the CLI from **[Ego4d CLI](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Ego4d/blob/main/ego4d/cli/README.md)**

## Download the annotations and relevant videos

You likely won't want the full dataset!
