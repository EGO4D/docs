# Welcome To Ego4d!

Ego4d is the world's largest egocentric (first person) video ML dataset and benchmark suite, with 3,400 hrs (and counting) of densely narrated video and a wide range of [annotations](./data-overview.md) across [benchmark tasks](./benchmarks/overview.md). It covers hundreds of scenarios (household, outdoor, workplace, leisure, etc.) of dailylife activity captured by 855 unique camera wearers from 74 worldwide locations and 9 different countries. Portions of the video are accompanied by audio, 3D meshes of the environment, eye gaze, stereo, and/or synchronized videos from multiple egocentric cameras at the same event.
