# Ego4D and EgoExo4D Challenge 2025

## **Overview**

At [EgoVis](https://egovis.github.io/cvpr25/) workshop during CVPR 2025, we will host **15** challenges representing Ego4D and EgoExo4D benchmarks. This year we will have **9** challenges from Ego4D and **6** challenges from EgoExo4D dataset. Please find details below on the challenges:

## **Ego4D challenges**


### [Episodic memory](./benchmarks/episodic-memory.md):

* [Visual queries with 2D localization (VQ2D)](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/1843/overview): Given an egocentric video clip and an image crop depicting the query object, return the most recent occurrence of the object in the input video, in terms of contiguous bounding boxes (2D + temporal localization).

Other Ego4D challenges which are not part of CVPR 2025 workshop remain open on EvalAI website for submissions but are not eligible for prizes.

## **EgoExo4D challenges**

Ego-Exo4D is a diverse, large-scale multi-modal multi view video dataset and benchmark challenge. Ego-Exo4D centers around simultaneously-captured ego-centric and exocentric video of skilled human activities (e.g., sports, music, dance, bike repair). 

Here are the specific challenge tracks we will host at [EgoVis workshop](https://egovis.github.io/cvpr25/) during CVPR 2025.

### EgoPose Benchmark

* [Ego-Pose Body](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/2245/overview): Given an egocentric video, estimate the 3D body pose of the camera-wearer. Specifically, predict the 3D position of the 17 annotated body joints for each frame. [[github]](https://github.com/EGO4D/ego-exo4d-egopose/tree/main/bodypose) [[tutorials]](https://docs.ego-exo4d-data.org/tutorials/)
* [Ego-Pose Hands](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/2249/overview): Estimate the 3D locations of the defined hand joints for visible hand(s). Specifically, estimate the (x,y,z) coordinates of each joint in the egocentric coordinate frame. [[github]](https://github.com/EGO4D/ego-exo4d-egopose/tree/main/handpose) [[tutorials]](https://docs.ego-exo4d-data.org/tutorials/)

### Relations Benchmark
* [Correspondence](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/2288/overview): Given a pair of timesynchronized egocentric and exocentric videos, as well as a query object track in one of the views, the goal is to output the corresponding mask for the same object instance in the other view for all frames where the object is visible in both views. [[github]](https://github.com/EGO4D/ego-exo4d-relation/tree/main/correspondence/)

### Keystep Benchmark
* [Fine-grained Keystep Recognition](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/2273/overview): The objective of this task is to predict the keystep label for a trimmed egocentric video clip. [[github]](https://github.com/EGO4D/ego-exo4d-keystep/tree/main/fine_grained/)
* [Procedure Understanding](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/2286/overview): The objective of this task is to infer a procedure's underlying structure from observing natural videos of subjects performing the procedure. [[github]](https://github.com/EGO4D/ego-exo4d-keystep/tree/main/procedure_understanding)

### Proficiency Benchmark
* [Demonstrator Proficiency](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/2291/overview):Given synchronized egocentric and exocentric video of a demonstrator performing a task, classify the proficiency skill level of the demonstrator. [github](https://github.com/EGO4D/ego-exo4d-proficiency/blob/main/demonstrator_proficiency/)

Other EgoExo4D challenges which are not part of CVPR 2025 workshop remain open on EvalAI website for submissions but are not eligible for prizes.


## Dataset

Ego4D challenge participants will use Ego4D’s annotated data set of more than 3,670 hours of video data, capturing the daily-life scenarios of more than 900 unique individuals from nine different countries around the world. Unique train, validation and unannotated test sets are available to download per challenge at [https://ego4d-data.org/docs/](https://ego4d-data.org/docs/). This year's challenge we will continue to use Ego4D v2.0 which contains ~2X train and val annotations for Forecasting, Hands & Objects and NLQ, a number of corrections and usability enhancements, and two new related dataset enhancements (Ego Schema and Goal Step). The test set remains the same as previous versions of the challenge. More details can be found [here](https://ego4d-data.org/docs/updates/). 


EgoExo4D challenge participants will be using EgoExo4D dataset for these challenges. Please find the [documentation](https://docs.ego-exo4d-data.org/) here about the dataset.


## Participation Guidelines


Participate in the contest by registering on the [EvalAI challenge page](https://eval.ai/) and creating a team. All participants must register as a part of a “participating team” on EvalAI to ensure the submission limits are honored. Participants will upload their predictions in the format specified for the specific challenge, and will be evaluated on AWS instances by comparing to ground truth predictions. Instructions for training, local evaluation, and online submission are provided at EvalAI. Please refer to the individual EvalAI pages for each challenge for submission guidelines, task specifications, and evaluation criteria.


## Dates


* Ego4D challenges will launch on March 5, 2025 with the leaderboard closing on May 19, 2025. 
* EgoExo4D challenges will launch on March 5, 2025 with the leaderboard closing on May 19, 2025. 
* Winners for both will be announced at the [Second Joint Egocentric Vision Workshop](https://egovis.github.io/cvpr24/) at CVPR 2025. 


## Competition Rules and Prize Information

## Challenge Reports


In addition to the submission on EvalAI, participants must submit a report describing their method to the workshop CMT [link](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/EgoVis2025/). In addition to your method and results, please remember to include examples of positive and negative results (limitations) of your model. These validation reports will be evaluated by challenge hosts from the Ego4D consortium before winner determination can be made. Similarly, challenge validation reports, research code from winning entries, and names of participants from the winning teams for all successful submissions must be shared publicly with the research community.  More details can be found on the [EgoVis workshop page](https://egovis.github.io/cvpr25/).
