# Privacy and Ethics

From the onset, privacy and ethics standards were critical to this data collection effort. Each partner was responsible for developing a policy. While specifics vary per site, common guidelines have been followed. Please refer to our [statement by members of the consortium on issues of privacy and ethics for further details](https://ego4d-data.org/pdfs/Ego4D-Privacy-and-ethics-consortium-statement.pdf). Our standards typically require that video be captured in controlled environments with informed consent or else in public where faces and other PII are blurred. In total, 612 hours of the EGO4D dataset contains video where participants consented to remain unblurred.  Please reference “[Ego4D: Around the World in 3,000 Hours of Egocentric Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07058)” for detailed information about our de-identification process, standards, and collection efforts. Should any researcher, participant or data user encounter clips they have been insufficiently redacted, or for any other privacy concerns, please contact us immediately at [privacy@ego4d-data.org](mailto:privacy@ego4d-data.org).
